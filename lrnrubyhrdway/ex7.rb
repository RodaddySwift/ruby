#More Printing Exercise...
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}." #this is not a variable, but Ruby will print the text. But
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
puts "." * 10 #what'd I do? he placed a string 10 times by mulitplying it.

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

#watch that print vs puts on this line what's it do? - the puts outputs the text immediately where as the print
#concatenates them.

print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 + end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
